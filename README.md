once you have downloaded the archive there should be a single folder in it, put that folder in the .atom folder

a quick way to acces that folder is to do this:

2) go to settings, Ctrl+comma
3) click on the "open config folder" button
4) expand the .atom folder on the left
5) rightlick any of the files or folder int the .atom folder, and select "open in explorer"
